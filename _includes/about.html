        <p class="lead"> 
          I'm a master's student in Computational Clinical Science Lab, Seoul National Unversity. 
          I'm broadly interested in psychiatric disorders, especially in mood and anxiety disorder and their decision-making.
          I want to figure out the psychological and neurocognitive mechanisms of aberrant decision-making in mood and anxiety disorder.
          Specifically, by applying computational and neurobiological approaches, I hope to discover 
          (1) underlying cognitive processes of decision-making under mood and anxiety disorder,
          (2) individuals' risk factors and prognosis, 
          and ultimately enable to provide 
          (3) quantitative and objective index of psychiatric disorders and 
          (4) individualized treatment.  <br>
