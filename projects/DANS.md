I attended data analysis in neuroscience at Seoul National University from Feb 18 - Feb 22. I learned a lot about how to analyze the brain data, statistical methods, and many other useful things. I also did a group project in the last day of the DANS. 

Here is the related material of the final project. [DANS](/assets/DANS_FINAL.pdf)
